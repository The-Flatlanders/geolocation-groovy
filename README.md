How to set up eclipse to work with this project:
to install plugins in eclipse, you will need to go to help>install new software.
In the box labeled work with, you will paste links to download sites where the plugins we need are available. The first site you will need to paste in this area is 
http://dist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.5/
This is the download site for the groovy plugin for eclipse.
Second, you will need the git plugin for eclipse. This is available at 
http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates 
Once you have both of these plugins installed, you are ready to proceed.

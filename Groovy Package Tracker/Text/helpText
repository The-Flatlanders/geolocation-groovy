How to Use the Package Tracker

UUID TAB:
Adding a package to the map:
Navigate to the UUID tab by clicking on the tab labeled UUID on the upper left. It is also the default tab when you first access the map page. Then, enter into the text box labeled "Add UUID" the UUID associated with your package. This is just a long string of letters and numbers unique to every package. After you press submit your package will be easily viewed on the map to the right.

OTHER BUTTONS:
Clicking on "Refresh Map" will refresh all of your packages. This will update their positions on the map and their details in the details tab, described more later. Clicking on "Help" brings up this menu.

DETAILS TAB:
When you first navigate to this tab, you may be dismayed because it is empty. The key is that the tab remains blank until you click on a package. After you click on a package, henceforth referred to as the active package, you can see all of its information in the details tab. This includes aspects of the active package like its location, destination, and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). You will also see a notes section. This is a place that you can add notes to remind yourself about the package. Notes you add will be visible by anyone else who has access to the UUID, usually just you and the package administrator. This therefore serves as a great and easy way to communicate with IDT. 

MAP HELP:
Clicking on a package places focus on it, turning it into the current active package. The map automatically zooms in to focus on the package, its destination point, and its start point, conveniently marked with pins. A green pin signifies the end while a blue pin signifies the beginning. You will also notice that an active package has a line leading back from it to its starting point. This shows the path the package took with as much accuracy as possible.
